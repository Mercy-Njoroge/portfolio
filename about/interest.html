    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
       <p>I am an introvert naturally.but who said introverts can't have fun?
        I have a couple of things i love to do when i'm free and relaxing

        <p>I love listening to music,any music that i feel inspiring to me, hence i've grown to love 
        different genres of music,so i dont have a specific genre i listen to.
      </p>
        <p>And i also get to enjoy reading to watchng, and i'd rather read the book instead
        of watch the movie </p>
        <p>Maybe because of being an introvert and not that outgoing i realised i can express myself
            better in writting that personally aproaching peple and telling them what i thing i prefer
            writting.so i find myself writting whenever i'm free or going through a tough phase,and it helps 
            me relax expecially because i find it hard to trust people.
